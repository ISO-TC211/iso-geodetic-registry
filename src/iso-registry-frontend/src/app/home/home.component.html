      The ISO Geodetic Registry is a structured database of coordinate reference
      systems and transformations that is accessible through this on-line
      registry system. The Register includes only systems and transformations of
      international application. It does not include all possible coordinate
      reference systems and transformations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Registry is provided under the auspices of ISO Technical Committee
      211 on geographic information/geomatics and conforms to ISO standards ISO
      19111:2007 (Spatial referencing by coordinates), the soon to be published
      ISO/TS 19127 (Geodetic register), ISO 19135:2005 (Procedures for item
      registration) and its soon to be published revision ISO 19135-1
      (Procedures for item registration - Part 1: Fundamentals), and ISO
      19135-2:2012 (Procedures for item registration -- Part 2: XML schema
      implementation).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Registry may be used free of charge but its use is subject to
      acceptance of the
      <a href="https://geodetic-staging.isotc211.org/terms" target="_blank"
        >Terms of Use</a
      >. Use of the Registry implies acceptance of these Terms of Use. Users of
      the Registry may query and view data and generate reports via anonymous
      guest access. Users may also submit proposals for new additions or
      clarifications to the registry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Registry also provides a web service interface, allowing geospatial
      software to query and retrieve information from the Register. Information
      on using the web services is available in the
