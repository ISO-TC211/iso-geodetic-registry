# Internationalization

The HTML views used by the GDI-DE Registry are located under 'src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\views'. 

All translations are located in the files "messages.xml" and "messages_XX.xml" where
XX is a lower-case two-character language code (e.g. "messages_en.xml" contains English
translations).

*It is essential that the '.xml' files are encoded in UTF-8!*
